# Level 400 - Week 3 - Connecting Frontend and Backend

In this step you should connect your React and Node apps so that data is stored and retrieved from the API

When completed, you should not be reading data from a local variable in your React app, you should be using `fetch` to retrieve your data from the API you have just built.

## API access from React

Since we are doing a monorepo design the API is accessible on the same route as the frontend. This means you are able to use calls like `fetch("/api/videos")` and it will properly connect to your backend.

## Automated tests

**Note:** if you have been doing the automated test exercise from level 199 you will need to update it. The example test file we have provided contains some commented out code that shows how you would be able to mock `fetch` calls by both specifying what they should return as well as checking what input they received. Make sure to update the tests accordingly, so they still run successfully.

## Ordered data

If you have been doing the optional exercise for both frontend and backend to support ordering, then this is the perfect time to link the two features together. If you have only done one of them (either the backend or the frontend) you might want to implement the other part as well at this point.
