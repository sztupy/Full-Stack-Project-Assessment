# Level 350 - Week 3 - Final checks

Make sure to verify that all of the features work and they are deployed to the internet.

To confirm the minimum set of features you need to show are the following:

- Page is showing a list of video recommendations
- Youtube videos are shown embedded, and can be played from the website
- Videos can be added to the website
- Videos can be deleted from the website
- Videos can be rated by voting up and down
- All changes are saved to the database

Congratulations you have deployed your Full Stack Project to the internet! Make sure to ask a tech ed volunteer to go through your implementation and verify that it works as expected. Once they do that you will be approved to join the graduation project!

If you have time you should still check any optional levels that you have missed so far. If you wish this to be one of your portfolio piece we strongly recommend checking level 399 as well. Afterwards you can also find some additional ideas at level 499 that we recommend you taking a look at!
