# Level 350 - Week 2/B - Backend Deployment

By the end of this level you will have both your frontend and backend deployed to the internet, although they will not use each other.

## Render

If you have ben following the guidelines of level 150 and level 250, Render should autoamtically pick up your backend and connect it with the database. To test your endpoints use Postman, they should be available at:

```
https://<your-render-url>.onrender.com/api/videos
```

Use Postman and make sure you can use all of the APIs tou have created - listing videos, creating and deleting videos and rating them up and down.
