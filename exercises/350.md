# Level 350 - Week 2/B - Backend Deployment

By the end of this level you will have both your frontend and backend deployed to the internet, although they will not use each other.

## Netlify

If you have been following the setup steps of level 150 then Netlify should already be deploying your backend. However you still need to set up a link between your backend and the database.

To do that open up your site confirugation in Netlify, and head over to "Environmental variables". Once you are there click "Add a Variable", "Add a Single Variable", and fill in with the following details:

* Key: `DATABASE_URL`
* Values:
  * Use "Same value for all deploy contexts"
  * Login to ElephantSQL and open up your database's dashboard
  * Copy the value that you can see in the URL field. It should look something like `postgres://xxx:somepassword@berry.db.elephantsql.com/xxx`
  * Paste this value on Netlify

Once you are ready click "Create variable". This will redeploy your application. Once that is done you should be able to access your API at:


```
https://<your-netlify-url>.netlify.app/api/videos
```

Use Postman and make sure you can use all of the APIs tou have created - listing videos, creating and deleting videos and rating them up and down.
