# Level 199 - Week 1 - Frontend - Stretch Goals

Here are some additional tasks for you to complete should you finish everything in Level 100

You can work on them in any order

## 1) Ordering Results

When you load the data, order it so that the video with the most upvotes is at the top and least is are the bottom.

## 2) Data Validation

When a video is added, make sure that the title is not empty and that the url is a valid YouTube URL

## 3) Uploaded Date

When a user uploads a video store the date and time that they posted it at.

Add when the video was uploaded to the Video React component

## 4) Material UI

As a further stretch goal, consider adding the Material UI library

Material UI is a _Design System_ that can help you to design great looking websites and apps. When using a design system you should use the guidelines that they put in place. You can read more about these guidelines here:

## 5) Unit tests


### Setup

As a further stretch goal consider adding unit tests checking that your components are adhering to the requirements. We have helped you get started by adding a couple tests to `client/test/App.test.js`. These would check that the page, after loading, contains enough `<iframe>` blocks, as well as whether the `Remove video` button works as expected, by decreasing the number of `<iframe>`s on the page. To run these tests type in the following command:

```
npm run test:client
```

Check the response, it will tell you if the tests have succeeded or not. It is likely that you will need to update the test to cater for how you have implemented your website. For example if you don't have a button that says `Remove video` but for example opted to put a little trashcan icon instead, you will need to change the sections where the code presses the `Remove video` button to instead find and press your trash icon on the page.

### Enable PR tests

Tests are useful to run every time you create a PR to make sure you don't accidentally add or change code that breaks existing functionality. You can go to `.github/workflows/run-client-tests.yml` and remove the comment from the line that says `pull_request:`. This will run the `npm run test:client` call every time you create a new PR blocking merging in case tests fail.

### Add new tests

You might want to add some new test cases. Here are some examples:

* Verify that the rating goes up / down when the user presses the Up Vote / Down Vote buttons
* Verify that the user cannot create videos with invalid URLs (if you have implemented point 2 above)
