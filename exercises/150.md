# Level 150 - Week 1 - Front End Deployment

By the end of this level you will have a React website that is available on the internet

## Render

We will be using Render to deploy your application. You should follow the following guides:

* [Connect your GitHub account to Render](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-render/connecting-github)
* [Deploy your application to Render](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-render/deploying-server)

Please note this repository is already pre-configured for render using a file called `render.yaml`.
