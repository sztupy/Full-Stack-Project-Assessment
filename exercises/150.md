# Level 150 - Week 1 - Frontend Deployment

By the end of this level you will have a React website that is available on the internet

## Render

We will be using Render to deploy your application. If you haven't done so yet first make sure to [Connect your GitHub account to Render](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-render/connecting-github)

This repository already has a Render blueprint available that will set up the backend, frontend and database components. This file is called `render.yaml` and you can find it in the root directory. To use this, after logging in the Ronder click the `New +` button, then select `Blueprint` from the list.

Once selected you should find your project in the list below. Click `Connect`, then fill in the next page, and finally click `Apply`. Once that's you need to wait for the system to create your app, after which it will go live.

## Automated Deployments

Render will link to your GitHub account and will automatically update the deployed application whenever you merge your PRs to the `main` branch. For every PR, it will also generate a snapshot of that build so you can verify if your PR is actually working before merging.

## Failed Deployments

Occasionally automated deployments (including the first one) might fail or get stuck. One way to try to unstuck them is to force a new manual deployment. To do that go to your render `Dashboard`, select the `video-recommendation` Web Service, then click `Manual Deploy`, and select `Deploy latest commit`. This will rety the deployment from start. You will also be able to check the logs of the deployment and see if there are any issues.
