# Level 150 - Week 1 - Frontend Deployment

By the end of this level you will have a React website that is available on the internet

## Netlify

We will be using Netlify to deploy your application. If you haven't done so yet first make sure to [Sign up to Netlify using GitHub](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-netlify/first-site)

This repository already has a Netlify blueprint available that will set up both the backend and the frontend components. This file is called `netlify.toml` and you can find it in the root directory. This file will be picked up automatically when you import your project, so you won't need to set up things like the "Build command" or "Publish directory" values.

## Automated Deployments

Netlify will link to your GitHub account and will automatically update the deployed application whenever you merge your PRs to the `main` branch. For every PR, it will also generate a snapshot of that build so you can verify if your PR is actually working before merging.
