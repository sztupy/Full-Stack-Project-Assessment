# Level 150 - Week 1 - Front End Deployment

By the end of this level you will have a React website that is available on the internet

## Render

We will be using Render to deploy your application. If you haven't done so yet first make sure to [Connect your GitHub account to Render](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-render/connecting-github)

This repository already has a Render blueprint available that will set up the backend, frontend and database components. This file is called `render.yaml` and you can find it in the root directory. To use this, after logging in the Ronder click the `New +` button, then select `Blueprint` from the list.
