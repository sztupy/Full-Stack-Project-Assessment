# Level 150 - Week 1 - Checking Acceptance criteria

Once you finish your work it is always good to go through what you have done and verify it.

For this step let's revisit the user stories from Level 100:

- As a CYF trainee I want to show my favourite videos so my friends know what videos I like
- As a friend I want to see the trainee's recommended videos so I can watch them myself
- As a friend I want to see the title of each video so I know what the video is about
- As a friend I want to be able to go to YouTube by clicking any of the titles so I can actually watch the recommendation

To check that your implementation adheres to the user stories above make sure to:

- Check that the website shows your favourite videos
- Check that you can send the website to your friends
- Check with your friends that they can also check your favourite videos
- Check that you and your friends can all see the titles of your videos, and if they click on them they get redirected to YouTube to watch those videos

Congratulations! You have finished your MVP! Feel free to look at Level 199 for some optional extras that will make your project stand out, or continue with the Week 2 exercises.
