# Level 450 - Week 3 - Final checks

By the end of this level you will have both your frontend and backend deployed to the internet, and now they communicate to each other.

## Deployment

If you have been following the guidelines of level 150 and level 250 your website should already be available and it's frontend and backend components will already be connected. Please double check to make sure this is the case.

Congratulations you have deployed your Full Stack Project to the internet! Make sure to ask a tech ed volunteer to go through your implementation and verify that it works as expected.

If you have time you can still check any optional levels that you have missed so far, including level 499!
