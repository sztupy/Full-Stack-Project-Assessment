# Level 200 - Week 2/A - Database

The first half of the second week you will be designing the database schema and the initial seed data for your project.

## Initdb.sql

Inside the `db` directory you will find a script called `initdb.sql`. Update it to make sure that it does the following steps:

* Creates the relevant tables to store the videos in the database
* Inserts the 10 example videos from `exampleresponse.json` to the database

## Initiating local database

Make sure you create a new database for yourself, for example let's call it `videorec`. From a shell use `createdb` to create a new database for yourself:

```
createdb videorec
```

Once it is created try to load your file into the database using `psql`:

```
psql -d videorec < db/initdb.sql
```

Note: dependent on how postgresql was installed for you, you might need to add some connectivity details to both `createdb` and `psql`:

```
psql -h localhost -U username -d videorec < db/initdb.sql
```

In this example you ask postgres to connect to your local database through `localhost` and use `username` as the user.

## Re-running the script

It is advised to make sure that the `initdb.sql` can be run multiple times, and each run would reset the database to a known initial state. One way to do it is to add SQL code to the start that would delete tables in case they exist, something like:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS videos CASCADE;
```

Try running your `initdb.sql` script multiple times to make sure every time you get a fresh and clean database.


## Designing SQL code for the backend functionalities

Next step is making sure you will know what SQL commands you will use for the core functionalities. Make sure you write them down, including what parameters they will required.

For example for obtainig a single video from the database your SQL code might look like the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM videos WHERE id = $1
```

Where `$1` is the parameter that this call requires.

Make sure to design the call for the following actions as well:

* Obtainig all videos in the database
* Deleting a video from the database
* Creating a new video in the database
* Rating a video up
* Rating a video down
