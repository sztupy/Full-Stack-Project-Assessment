# Level 250 - Week 2/A - Database deployment

By the end of this level you will have your database running under ElephantSQL

## ElephantSQL

ElephantSQL is a database-as-a-service provider allowing you to host PostgreSQL databases. To set up your database do the following:

1. Sign up for a new account on their signup page: https://customer.elephantsql.com/signup Feel free to use "Sign Up with GitHub" for ease of access.
2. Click the "Create new instance" button.
3. On the "Plan" page you will only be able to select the `"Tiny Turtle (Free)"` plan. Do that.
4. Set the name of the databasae to `video-recommendations`.
5. No need to set tags, continue to the next page
6. On the region page select `"EU-West-1 (Ireland)"`
7. Finally click "Review" then "Create Instance"

Once you do that you will be able to select your `video-recommendations` instance from the list. Do that and you'll find all of the details you need to connect to the database.

## Uploading database

To upload your data to the database you will need the following details:

1. The server. This will be something like `flora.db.elephantsql.com`
2. The username. This will be something like `yqunykyc`. This will also be your database name.
3. Your password. You need to click on the copy icon to obtain it.

Now you have all of the details that you need to use on the command line to import your script:

```
psql -h server_from_above -U username_from_above database_name_from_above < db/initdb.sql
```

Postgres will ask you for your password, make sure to provide it and then check that the code runs successfully, and you might want to verify that the tables and example values are all there.
