# Level 250 - Week 2/A - Database deployment

By the end of this level you will have your database running on the Internet as well

## Deployment

If you picked Render or Fly.io you want to use their own database offering. If you picked Netlify you can use either ElephantSQL or Supabase

## Install initial database

Make sure you connect to your online database and install your `initdb.sql` script so it contains your initial set of schema and data.
